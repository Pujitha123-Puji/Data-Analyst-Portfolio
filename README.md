Project Title: Pizza Sales Report
The Pizza Sales Report project is a data analysis and visualization initiative aimed at uncovering meaningful insights from a pizza restaurantâ€™s sales data. The goal was to evaluate business performance, identify sales trends, and support data-driven decision-making. This project was executed using Structured Query Language (SQL) for data extraction and transformation, and Power BI for visualization and reporting.

Data Sources and Tools:
The dataset consisted of sales records from a fictional pizza store, typically including tables such as orders, order_details, pizzas, pizza_types, and customers. SQL was used to query and prepare the data. All necessary data cleaning, joining, filtering, and aggregating were done using SQL. Once the data was cleaned and structured, it was imported into Power BI, where interactive dashboards were developed to present key performance indicators (KPIs) and insights.

Objectives:
The main objectives of the project were:

#To analyze total sales performance over time.
#To determine the best and worst-selling pizzas.
#To examine customer order patterns.
#To identify peak business hours and most profitable days.
#To provide a dashboard that helps business managers make informed decisions.

#Key Metrics and Analysis:
Using SQL, various KPIs and summaries were generated such as:

#Total Revenue: Calculated by summing the prices of all orders.

#Total Orders: The count of unique order IDs.

#Average Order Value: Total revenue divided by total orders.

#Top 5 Best-Selling Pizzas: Identified using GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses.

#Monthly and Weekly Sales Trends: Created using DATEPART() and GROUP BY for time-based analysis.

#Peak Hours and Days: Identified by aggregating order counts and revenue by hour and weekday.

The SQL queries were optimized to ensure efficient data processing and accurate output.

#Visualization in Power BI
The cleansed and processed data was visualized using Power BI. The report consisted of multiple interactive pages including:

Overview Dashboard: Showcasing key metrics such as total sales, number of orders, average revenue per order, and charts displaying sales by month and pizza category.

Pizza Performance: A deep dive into the sales performance of individual pizzas, including heatmaps, bar charts, and rankings.

Time Analysis: Line charts and time slicers showing sales by hour, day, and month to identify demand patterns.

Customer Insights: Order frequency and customer segmentation if data allowed.

Power BI features such as slicers, filters, and drill-down capabilities were utilized to enhance interactivity and allow users to explore data from different perspectives.

#Conclusion:
The Pizza Sales Report project successfully demonstrated how data analytics tools like SQL and Power BI can be integrated to deliver actionable business intelligence. By analyzing sales patterns and visualizing them clearly, the project provided valuable insights that can help a pizza business optimize inventory, marketing strategies, and staff scheduling. It also served as a solid hands-on experience in data handling, business analysis, and dashboard creation, making it a significant addition to any data enthusiast's portfolio.
